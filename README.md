# Systemtron_Neelima_ML
A supervised machine learning project that predicts the presence of diabetes using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Includes full EDA, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

##This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict diabetes in patients based on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. It uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and includes:
- Data loading and inspection
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and scaling
- Train-test splitting
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization using matplotlib & seaborn

##Developed as part of Week 1 of my Virtual Internship at SystemTron.
ðŸ”§ Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
ðŸ“Š Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
ðŸ§ª Dataset: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle/UCI)
